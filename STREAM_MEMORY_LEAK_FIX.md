# Stream Memory Leak Fix

## Problem
The app was throwing `setState() called after dispose()` errors when navigating away from the squares game page. This happened because Firestore stream listeners continued to call `setState()` even after the widget was disposed.

## Root Cause
- Real-time Firestore streams were not being properly cancelled when the widget was disposed
- Stream listeners would continue running and attempt to update a disposed widget
- This caused memory leaks and runtime errors

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Changed Stream Management Approach**
**Before**: Direct stream listening in separate methods
```dart
Stream<List<SquareSelectionModel>>? _selectionsStream;
// ...
_selectionsStream?.listen((data) => setState(() { ... }));
```

**After**: Proper StreamSubscription management
```dart
StreamSubscription<List<SquareSelectionModel>>? _selectionsSubscription;
// ...
_selectionsSubscription = _selectionService.selectionsStream().listen(...);
```

### 2. **Added Mounted Checks**
All stream listeners now check `if (mounted)` before calling `setState()`:
```dart
_selectionsSubscription = _selectionService.selectionsStream().listen(
  (selections) {
    if (mounted) {  // ← Prevents setState() on disposed widget
      setState(() {
        // Update UI
      });
    }
  },
);
```

### 3. **Proper Disposal**
Enhanced `dispose()` method to cancel all subscriptions:
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Cancel all stream subscriptions to prevent setState() after dispose
  _selectionsSubscription?.cancel();
  _scoresSubscription?.cancel();
  _boardNumbersSubscription?.cancel();
  _configSubscription?.cancel();
  
  _tabController.dispose();
  super.dispose();
}
```

### 4. **Error Handling**
Added error handling to stream listeners:
```dart
_selectionsSubscription = _selectionService.selectionsStream().listen(
  (data) { /* handle data */ },
  onError: (error) {
    print('Error in selections stream: $error');
  },
);
```

## Affected Components

### Fixed in SquaresGamePage:
- ✅ Selections stream subscription
- ✅ Scores stream subscription  
- ✅ Board numbers stream subscription
- ✅ Config stream subscription

### Already Safe in LaunchPage:
- ✅ Timer-based operations already had mounted checks
- ✅ Proper timer cancellation in dispose()

## Benefits
1. **No Memory Leaks**: Streams are properly cancelled when widget is disposed
2. **No Runtime Errors**: setState() is never called on disposed widgets
3. **Better Performance**: Resources are cleaned up appropriately
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Stream errors don't crash the app

## Testing
- Navigate between pages rapidly
- No more `setState() called after dispose()` errors
- Real-time updates still work correctly when widget is mounted
- App performance remains smooth

This fix ensures proper lifecycle management and prevents memory leaks in the Flutter app.
