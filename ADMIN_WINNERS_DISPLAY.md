# Admin Dashboard Winner Display Enhancement

## Overview
The admin dashboard now shows detailed winner information and prize amounts for each quarter when scores are set.

## Enhanced Features

### Quarter Score Cards Now Display:

1. **🏆 Main Winner**
   - Shows winning square coordinates
   - Prize amount: $2400

2. **📍 Adjacent Winners** 
   - Count of adjacent squares
   - Total prize pool: (count × $150)
   - Adjacent squares: up, down, left, right from winner

3. **🔷 Diagonal Winners**
   - Count of diagonal squares  
   - Total prize pool: (count × $100)
   - Diagonal squares: corner squares touching the winner

4. **💰 Total Payout**
   - Sum of all prizes for that quarter
   - Calculation: $2400 + (adjacent × $150) + (diagonal × $100)

## Visual Layout Changes

### Grid Layout Updated:
- **Previous**: 4 columns × 1.2 aspect ratio
- **Current**: 2 columns × 0.8 aspect ratio (taller cards)
- **Reason**: More space to display winner information

### Color-Coded Prize Display:
- **Green**: Main winner ($2400)
- **Amber**: Adjacent winners ($150 each)
- **Blue**: Diagonal winners ($100 each)  
- **Purple**: Total payout summary

## Example Display

When admin sets Q1 score as Home: 17, Away: 24:
```
Q1
Home: 17
Away: 24
Winner: 7-4

🏆 Square 7-4 ($2400)
📍 4 adjacent ($600)
🔷 4 diagonal ($400)
💰 Total: $3400
```

## Technical Implementation

### Winner Calculation Logic:
- **Winning Square**: Uses last digit of each team's score
- **Adjacent**: 4 squares (up/down/left/right) with wrapping
- **Diagonal**: 4 corner squares with wrapping
- **Wrapping**: Board edges connect (0↔9) for fair play

### Future Enhancement:
Currently shows square coordinates as placeholder. In production with actual square selections, this would display:
- Actual user names who own each winning square
- Multiple winners per category if multiple users selected same squares

## Admin Benefits:
- **Quick Prize Overview**: See total payouts per quarter
- **Winner Verification**: Easily identify who won what
- **Payout Calculation**: Automatic prize amount calculations
- **Visual Clarity**: Color-coded categories for easy reading

The enhanced display provides administrators with complete prize information at a glance, making game management and payout processing much more efficient.
